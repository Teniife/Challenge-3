# Password Generator Starter Code
Randomized Password Generator project

## Description

This weekly challenge was to finish making a password generator with Javascript after getting the source code which had all the HTML and CSS already completed




## Installation
Source code provided on bootcamp spot. I placed lowercase, uppercase, numbers and special characters all in their own array and made a function to call characters from each array based on prompts asking the consumer what they want the desired password to contain.
